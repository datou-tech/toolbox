### A Better Terminal - iTerm2

iTerm2 provides features that improve the base OSX terminal experience that are much easier to configure and maintain such as profiles, default window sizing, colors, fonts and more.

1. Install iTerm2 [here](https://iterm2.com/)
1. Open iTerm2
1. Configure your first profile - &#8984;-O
1. Choose Default Profile > Edit Profiles

These are my personal minimalistic settings with a dash of customization.

| Tab | Customization | My Values | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Text | Font | Monaco 16px | A nice mono-space font ;-) |
| New Windows | Columns x Rows | 160 x 45 | Not too big, not too small |
| Terminal | Scrollback Lines | 10,000 | Not too much, not too little
| Keys | Add Key Mapping + | Alt-left (⌥&larr;) <br/> Send Escape Sequence <br/> Esc+b | Allows for jumping words to the left |
| Keys | Add Key Mapping + | Alt-right (⌥&rarr;) <br/> Send Escape Sequence <br/> Esc+f | Allows for jumping words to the right |

### Best Practices

With iTerm2 - there is another practice I like to do. Copy the base Default Profile into different intended profiles like "Production", "Development", etc. I will then color code the window/fonts so differentiate the context you are doing work in.
