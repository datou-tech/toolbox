VSCode comes with an incredible amount of plugins that enhance the developer experience. Here are some of my favorites with key shortcuts. You can find these in the marketplace when you open VS Code. (Left nav - Tetris Icon)

These are some of the base extensions I use. There will be more that I would recommend installing but you will find them within the context to other tools in this repo.
