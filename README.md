## Toolbox

#### Summary

A collection of 3rd party tools for the modern engineer that enjoys fine tuned instruments of creation. 

I try to optimize for the best "hands on keyboard" (HOK) experience which means avoiding instances where I take my hand off the keyboard to use the mouse (or trackpad). So you will find each readme will include a `HOK` section at the bottom if there are tips &amp; tricks.

#### How To Use

This repo will have folders that represent different domains. If you are just starting out in this repo, I encourage you to begin with ./shell and ./terminal. They are used to set up the other tools.
